              Colleges in the country to introduce Post-Graduate Education in
              Ayurveda as early as in 1970.

              Institute has grown tremendously in the field of Teaching,
              Training, Research, Patient Care etc., as a result of which it has

              and research.
              
              <br /><br /> Since its existence, it has continuously been
              engaged in promoting reforms and developments in Ayurveda System

              <br /><br /> Establishment of Manuscript unit in
              NIA 
              
              <br /><br />National Institute of Ayurveda, the prime apex institute of
              Ayurveda, is known for its long generous classical tradition. It
              might give proper direction to Ayurveda manuscriptology by
              utilizing its huge academic resources and can only be able to
              explore those hidden treasures to the rest of the world for the
              benefit of the mankind. Hence the study of Ayurveda manuscript
              should be continued and must be encouraged in the institute to
              improve the qualities of Ayurveda scholars in this field.
              
              <br /><br /> The
              AYUSH system of medicine and treatment is gaining immense
              popularity across the globe. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has
              given an opportunity to strengthen the user base of ayurveda
              across the globe. The credits behind the effort to mainstream
              AYUSH system of medicine go to the leadership of the Ministry of
              AYUSH, Government of India. The researchers from all streams of
              medicine are not only interested in the established Ayurveda
              principles, but also are focusing on unexplored principles of
              ayurveda. Thus, it can be considered as the ideal time to
              recognize the importance of Ayurveda manuscriptology and work
              towards the development of manuscript unit. Access to the
              information available in the unpublished manuscripts will only
              strengthen the global demand of Ayurveda.
